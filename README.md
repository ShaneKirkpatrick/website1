<h3><a name="About us"></a> About us </h3>
<p> Kirkpatrick Media was created in 2020 by Shane Kirkpatrick as a place where he could post photos, vidoes, articles, other social media content and free resources. This was created out of frustration and excitement. These thoughts were born out of the idea that there is a ton of free content, entertainment, and production applications. Everything here is made as an example of what you can do if you are interested. Please email Shane with any thoughts, comments, or criticisms: shaneckirkpatrick@gmail.com</p> <br />
